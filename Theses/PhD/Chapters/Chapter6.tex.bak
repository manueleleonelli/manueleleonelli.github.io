The implementation of Bayesian methods for a group decision analysis involving the assessment and the aggregation of both probabilistic and utility models in complex systems has often been considered too difficult to be developed because of the unwieldy large number of factors and interactions that needs to be taken into account. In this paper we have considered both a dynamic and a non-dynamic framework in which, from a theoretical point of view at least, it is possible to feasibly deal with such a class of problems. As shown by the above example all calculations are straightforward and scale up, albeit with a large number of moments or probabilities to be computed, stored and transmitted between panels. However, these quantities can be provided by an IDSS. So the large number of computations necessary for coherently evaluating different policies  are  actually trivial ones and operationally computable in real time. We note that the algorithms we define in this multi-expert system are closely related to the ones already cited for the propagation of probabilities and expected utilities in graphical structures, which have now been successfully implemented in many large applications (G\'{o}mez, 2004; Oliver and Smith, 1990). So we can be confident that our methods remain feasible for current and much larger applications.

The critical assumption of our methodology is that the collective observes all the  data they planned to collect. Of course it is very common in practice for data about, for example, the development of an accident to arrive non-sequentially. For instance, a van collecting deposition measurements can be delayed in transmitting these, so that readings are available from the last hour but not  the current ones. In such a situation the distributivity of the system is broken. We briefly mention two possible practical solutions here: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Panels can accommodate only a subset of the data into the system that is appropriately time ordered. This gives the basis for a framework to analyze the system. This can then be elaborated by the appropriate communication of extra information that does not satisfy the criteria;
\item Methods can be developed where the distributivity property can only be approximatively satisfied. These methods are beyond the scope of this paper. We have some encouraging new results in this area which will be formally reported in Smith et al (2015).
\end{itemize}
Of course in some applications the lost of distributivity is not critical and non-observable data can be treated using standard statistical missing data techniques (Little and Rubin, 2014). 

So it is feasible for an IDSS to support rapid policy evaluations even when drawing together judgments from diverse panels of probabilistic expert systems, provided conditions ensure distributivity (or this is approximately so). Distributivity can be guaranteed if the density associated with the graphical statistical model the collective agrees upon factorizes appropriately. In this paper we chose a specific, although a rather large, class of directed graphical models where this is so. However,  other classes of graphical models can also entertain a distributed analysis. For example chain event graphs (Smith and Anderson, 2008) and their dynamic variant (Barclay et al, 2013) might be able to provide in some domains a better representation of the involved uncertainties and consequently a more focused decision making. We plan to extend our results to additional classes of model in future research.
